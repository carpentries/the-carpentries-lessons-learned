## Does it work?

### Community and impact is growing 
(use metrics to show)

### People are retaing the skill we teach
- People are retaining and using skills we teach (use assessment data and testimonials to show)
- New skills, tools, etc. that we pick up by being part of the community (anecdotally) - originally in "Reuse of methods and resources" 

### Sharing and reuse of methodology and resources
- Reusing the Carpentries resources (lessons, lesson templates, workshop templates, etc.)
- Reusing pedagogical skills we teach in other course and teaching they do (anecdotally)
- New skills, tools, etc. that we pick up by being part of the community (anecdotally)

### Becoming an internationally recognised brand
- New countries and institutions running workshops
- Any other means to show?
- Impact beyond the Carpentries (?)

### Working with others
- Collaboration with other communities and institutions, feeding off each other and helping each other grow (international RSE community, the UKâ€™s Software Sustainability Institute, CodeRefinery, Dutch eScience Centre, ... )
