## History

Like many projects, it took many years for the Carpentries to become an overnight success, and how we operate today is best understood by recapitulating our successes and mistakes.

In 1995-96, Wilson organized a series of articles in *IEEE Computational Science & Engineering* titled, "What Should Computer Scientists Teach to Physical Scientists and Engineers?" [@wilson1996]. These grew out of the frustration he had working with scientists who were building large, complex programs without knowing why they should decompose their code into functions or what version control was. In response, John Reynders (then director of the Advanced Computing Laboratory at Los Alamos National Laboratory) invited Wilson and Brent Gorda (then at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratyr) to teach a week-long course to LANL staff.

That course ran for the first time in July 1998, and was repeated nine times over the next four years. We learned that intensive week-long courses are easy to schedule but overwhelming after the first two days, learners are too tired to focus. Second, much of what's taught about software engineering to undergraduate computer science students wasn't relevant to researchers. For example, it's hard to consider unit tests useful when you aren't in a programmer's mindset yet.

The LANL course materials were updated and released in 2004-05 with support from the Python Software Foundation [@wilson2006b] and were used twice in a semester-long graduate course at the University of Toronto. While students (and the occasional faculty member) found the course useful, it never found a home in the curriculum. Computer Science faculty believed the material was too basic to deserve a graduate credit. Meanwhile, other departments believed that courses like it ought to be offered by Computer Science as a service course.

> An undergraduate science degree in North America is roughly 1800 hours long; anyone who wants to add new material must either lengthen the program (which is financially and institutionally infeasible) or take something out. Thus, while most STEM faculty agree that their students should learn more programming, nothing changes because they can't agree on what to take out to make room for it. Saying, "We'll just add a little computing to every other course," is a cheat: five minutes per hour equals four entire courses in a four-year program. It also doesn't work, because when time runs short (as it always does), the "extra" material on programming gets dropped first.

Wilson rebooted Software Carpentry in May 2010 with support from several universities, academic computing centers, and government labs. 120 short video lessons were recorded during the subsequent 12 months, six week-long on-site classes were run for the backers, and an online class was run three times (a MOOC *avant la lettre*). This was the most successful version to date, in part because the scientific landscape itself had changed. Open access publishing, the data deluge in the life sciences, and concern about reproducible research had convinced a growing number of researchers that knowing how to program was no longer optional. However, there were still several shortcomings:

1. We found that five eight-hour days are more wearying than enlightening.
2. Only a handful of people contributed material.
3. Creating and maintaining videos was time-consuming.
4. Teaching online was largely ineffective, in part because of the difficulty of offering technical support.

Software Carpentry rebooted again in January 2012. This time, the model was two-day intensive workshops like those pioneered by The Hacker Within, a grassroots group of grad students helping grad students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Shortening the workshops made it possible for more people to attend and increased the proportion of the material they could absorb. It also forced us to think much harder about what skills scientists really needed. Out went object-oriented programming, XML, Make, and other topics. Instead, we focused on a small set of tools that enabled us introduce higher-level concepts  in a shorter amount of time.

Reaching more people allowed us to recruit new instructors from workshop participants, which in turn allowed us to scale. Switching to a "host site covers costs" model was equally important: funding was still needed for 1.5 core staff to lead the project and match instructors to workshops, but everything else funded itself.

Our most important discovery during this period was that many people are as interested in learning about better teaching practices as they are in learning about computing. We discuss this in detail in FIXME.

2014 saw the founding of the Software Carpentry Foundation, an independent non-profit under the auspices of NumFOCUS. The SCF held its first elections in January 2015, in which instructors who had taught over the past two years selected seven of their own as a Steering Committee. We quickly learned that:

1. Software Carpentry found that the first memebers of the organization were keener than those who joined later, so as numbers grew the time contributed per person decreased. By the time several hundred people are involved, most will be dipping in and out of conversations rather than taking part on a daily or weekly basis, and frameworks and procedures for accepting contribution become important.

2. A partnership model that focuses on shared commitment between organizations can help make clear how each organization can benefit from the other, codifying this on paper and asking for financial support from members was key to transitioning to a sustaining organization.

3.  "Bikeshedding" (i.e., arguing over minor, marginal issues) is a constant danger in an organization whose most vocal members enjoy programming. Squelching technical discussions has a chilling effect on conversation overall, but letting them go unchecked alienates people who don't have enough time to go down technical rabbit holes.

Later in 2015, a parallel organization called Data Carpentry was founded by Tracy Teal. Data Carpentry focused less on programming, or software development and more on using existing software tools for data analysis. With support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Data Carpentry built lessons, and an organizational model for itself. In early 2016 Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry began offering memberships together with the goal of testing a potential shared revenue model for an eventual joint organization. Organizational memberhsip revenues were shared equally by both organizations through 2016 and 2017. By the end of 2016 membership growth was strong and in 2017 memberhsips were covering expenses for both organizations. In late 2017 the governing bodies of both Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry agreed to merge the organizations together as one organization The Carpentries. 

In the process, the joint organization was founded at a new fiscal sponsor, Community Initiatives. In early 2018, staff of both organizations began working together and a new membership council election was held to elect the governing body, and membership revenue was booked to Community Initiatives and a joint future was built for the organizations together.  

In 2015, Dr. James Baker received a fellowship from the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) in the UK. In the process he was exposed to the Software Carpentry teaching model and found that it was exactly what the academic library community needed to spread digital skills in that communtiy. With Greg Wilson's blessing, he speculatively launched the idea of a Library Carpentry communtiy and began developing and testing lessons with learners. Library Carpentry quickly took to the the academic libraries community worldwide and rapidly built a governance strcuture and regular meetings, workshops, and activities for the global communtiy. Bolstered by a grant from the Institute for Museums and Library Service (IMLS) in 2017, The Carpentries was able to explore a merger of Library Carpentry with The Carpentries as its next lesson program. With much of membership growth being led by Library Carpentries communities, Library Carpentry officially became the third lesson program in 2018. 

Kari, can you FIXME and give background on the Sloan and Chan Zuckerberg grants for curriculum development etc.

Throughout the growth and expansion of Software Carpentry, then Data Carpentry and eventually Library Carpentry these sub-communities have followed a process of testing, validating and sustaining their efforts and activities with an extended community. Each has found success in activiating a community toward a collective cause, acquired initial funding from granting organizations based on demonstrating a community need, and finally sustained themselves through regular annual contributions from research organizations that support their cause. The Carpentries success has been its broad community, strong lesson programs with quality curriculum, and a strong ethos of contribution and foucs on helping member institutions do more with less for their own communities. With a relatively small annual investment in The Carpentries, member organizations are able to mentor, train and grow their people in technical skills, pedagogical practices, mentorship, curriculum design and more. Today at the time of writing The Carpentries has over 100 member organizations in FIXME countries worldwide.
