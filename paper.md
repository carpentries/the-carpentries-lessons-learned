Even before the pandemic-driven pivot to remote working, The Carpentries have been 
using online teaching methods to deliver Instructor Training to trainees from multiple 
countries and time zones. Participatory online meetings for Carpentry community discussions and 
teaching demonstrations were used pre-pandemic to involve community members and implement the [“lesson study”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesson_study). 
Hence, instructor trainers were already familiar with online platforms and video conferencing tools for 
running remote meetings and events to a large extent and were pre-adapted to switching to online teaching 
when the need arose. Below we describe how the community coped with the global COVID-19 pandemic and what 
lessons we learned.

### Community's response

TODO: something about the communities response to pandemic and switching to online mode of working, 
when first workshops started and how 
the numbers picked up. New Bonus Module for online teaching.

The community’s experiences have been reported in [various blogposts](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/resources_for_online_workshops.html?highlight=online) 
and have led to The Carpentries [official recommendations for teaching online workshops](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/).

### What we learned?

Delivering Carpentry workshops online afforded us with many opportunities, but also came with a price. 
People without a stable Internet connection or a personal computer were largely excluded. 
On the other hand, people were quick to adapt to new ways of working and 
learn new technologies. Online workshops can be as effective as in-person training with 
careful planning and preparation. We were able to draw from a much larger pool of instructors and helpers, 
and reach more learners. Less time was spent on room bookings, catering and travel -  reducing some 
impacts on the environment.

#### Things take longer online

Things are likely to take longer in a virtual setting than face-to-face, so one needs to factor in extra 
time for troubleshooting technical problems, going though the materials and challenges. More breaks are 
needed as people tire more quickly due to an increased cognitive load of having to manage multiple windows 
while following the instructor. For these reasons, pre-workshop setup sessions to help people 
set up and download data ahead of workshops became even more important to maximise instructional time at workshops.

#### Event facilitation is crucial

Online training needs extra facilitation, which is not needed in face-to-face events. An event facilitator 
will help make sure the virtual event is working well, participants are aware of which resources to use and 
what commands to type. Facilitators also manage participants to minimise background noise, help make effective 
use of non-verbal feedback in video-conferencing platforms, monitor and answer questions in the chat and bring 
anything from the chat to the attention of trainers/helpers, and manage breakout rooms.

#### Cognitive load is higher on everyone

It can be tiring and time consuming for the active instructor to monitor the chat, non-verbal feedback from 
participants and shared documents while they are presenting. Having an event facilitator frees up the instructor 
to instruct and the helpers to focus on helping.

Participants have watch what the instructor is doing in one window, type and replicate commands in another, 
follow chat and shared document for any shared code snippets while trying to hear what is being said over 
background noises and often low quality Internet connection.

#### Technical concerns are larger

Variation in technical skills are more apparent with online courses and technical difficulties tend to be even larger.
Initially, everyone had to familiarise themselves with different video conferencing tools "on the fly" 
and while the workshop was taking place, which placed additional load on instructors, helpers and participants. 
People were often not familiar with non-verbal reactions, which were used to indicate progress with exercises and 
quickly poll the audience. Frequent updates to video conferencing tools introduced further inconsistencies between 
different versions owned by participants. Poor Internet connections resulted in many participants not sharing their 
videos, which, coupled with the lack of non-verbal feedback, made it harder to know if people were following.

There was a number of video conferencing tools in use (e.g. Blackboard Collaborate, Microsoft Teams, Zoom), 
each with its own intricacies; the choice was often mandated by the institution hosting the workshop. The use of 
chat was crucial to keep everyone engaged and for answering questions in the background by helpers, and often 
superseded the use of shared notes documents (as this was one extra window to manage in often limited screen estate). 
The use of integrated chats was also preferred to standalone chat tools such as Slack, and was perceived as less 
distracting and easier to catch up with.

#### New inclusivity and accessibility concerns

We faced some new inclusivity and accessibility concerns - aiming to be inclusive of learners from different 
time zones and with varying levels of technical equipment for video calls and quality of Internet connection. 
In many countries, learners were reliant on access to computer labs at their institutions, which was restricted 
due to pandemic. Many did not have access to personal laptops or PCs (insert some references/testimonials). 
Online workshops were great for some people, but also highly exclusive and inaccessible for others with technical 
issues, caring or home-schooling duties.

TODO - any other accessibility issues, e.g. hearing, etc. ...

#### "Zoom fatigue"
some ideas:
- Half-day workshop formats are less tiring
- The agenda for an online event must have sufficient breaks for it to be effective and less tiring for those who are attending.

#### Anything else???

# Does it work?

* Responsible: Maneesha/Aleks
* Metrics on workshops, instructors, ...
* Assessment
* Impact beyond the Carpentries (?)
* Becoming an internationally recognised brand
* Collaboration with other communities and institutions, feeding off each other and helping each other grow (RSE community, the UK’s Software Sustainability Institute, CodeRefinery, etc. ) - Aleks

# Where are we going

* Responsible: Kari
* Geographic growth

# What have we not yet solved

* Responsible: Kari
* merge with previous secion?
* Why haven’t we seen growth in certain parts of world, certain types of universities
* How do people join a global and distributed community if they don’t have reliable internet access?
* Skills based assessments vs general impact survey
* Workshops specifically serving women
