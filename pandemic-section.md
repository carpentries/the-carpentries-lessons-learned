# How did we cope with the COVID-19 pandemic?

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic-driven pivot to remote working, The Carpentries have been
using online teaching methods to deliver Instructor Training to trainees from multiple
countries and time zones. Participatory online meetings for Carpentry community discussions and
teaching demonstrations were used pre-pandemic to involve community members and implement the [“lesson study”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesson_study) to improve our lessons and methods of teaching.
Hence, instructors and instructor trainers were already familiar with online platforms and video conferencing tools for
running remote meetings and events and were pre-adapted to switching to online teaching
when the need arose. 

## Community's response
When the COVID-19 pandemic stroke worldwide in early 2020, 
the community was quick to regroup in response. 

In March 2020, The Carpentries Core Team formed the [COVID-19 Response Task Force](https://github.com/carpentries/task-forces/blob/main/2020/COVID-19/COVID-19-charter.md) to develop a plan to pilot online 
instruction of The Carpentries curricula. The Task Force focused on the creation of [key resources](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/) 
to guide the wider community in the shift to online instruction and a collection of resources, strategies and experiences that have been [shared by the community](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/resources_for_online_workshops.html?highlight=online%20guides#resources-by-community).

By the end of April 2020, cloud instances on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) (for R-based workshops) and 
[My Binder](https://mybinder.org/) (for Python-based workshops) were being [offered as a backup for learners with installation issues](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/scaffolds/),
[official recommendations for Teaching Carpentries Workshops Online](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/). In addition, the Task Force published [a guide for organisers of online 
workshops](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/instructor-updates-for-online-workshops/) and ["Bonus Modules for Carpentries Instructors"](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training-bonus-modules/), containing 
short lessons intended to provide continuing education opportunities for our instructors as they switch to teaching 
online.

In May 2020, [a new series of themed discussions](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/05/online-workshop-themed-discussions/) centred around running online workshops was launched by The Carpentries Core Team. The goal of these calls was to discuss ongoing work around online workshops — from changes to workshop registration to best practices in using technology to manage the shift to online-only workshops. Themed discussions also allowed time for direct communication between the community members on experiences, lessons learned, challenges and questions arising from 
running online workshops.

All these efforts enabled the community to 
carry on with running workshops, teaching and learning, accessing software on the cloud via Web browsers where software 
installations were problematic and offering audiences similar experiences to in-person workshops.

## What we learned?

Delivering Carpentry workshops online afforded us with many opportunities, but also came with a price.
People without a stable Internet connection or a personal computer were largely excluded. Troubleshooting installation
and setup issues was harder. On the other hand, people were quick to adapt to new ways of working and
learn new technologies. Online workshops can be as effective as in-person training with
careful planning and preparation. We were able to draw from a much larger pool of remote instructors and helpers,
and reach more learners. Less time was spent on room bookings, catering and travel - reducing some
impacts on the environment.

### Things take longer online

Things are likely to take longer in a virtual setting than face-to-face, so one needs to factor in extra
time for troubleshooting technical problems, going though the materials and challenges. More breaks are
needed as people tire more quickly due to an increased cognitive load of having to manage multiple windows
while following the instructor. For these reasons, pre-workshop setup sessions to help people
set up and download data ahead of workshops became even more important to maximise instructional time at workshops.

### More event facilitation is needed

Online training needs extra facilitation, which is not needed in face-to-face events. An event facilitator
helps make sure the virtual event is working well, participants are aware of which resources to use and
what commands to type. Facilitators also manage participants to minimise background noise, help make effective
use of non-verbal feedback in video-conferencing platforms, monitor and answer questions in the chat and bring
anything from the chat to the attention of trainers/helpers, and manage breakout rooms.

### Cognitive load is higher on everyone

It can be tiring and time consuming for the active instructor to monitor the chat, non-verbal feedback from
participants and shared documents while they are presenting. Having an event facilitator frees up the instructor
to instruct and the helpers to focus on helping.

Participants have watch what the instructor is doing in one window, type and replicate commands in another,
follow chat and shared document for any shared code snippets while trying to hear what is being said over
background noises and often low quality Internet connection.

### Technical concerns are larger

Variation in technical skills are more apparent with online courses and technical difficulties tend to be even larger.
Initially, everyone had to familiarise themselves with different video conferencing tools "on the fly"
and while the workshop was taking place, which placed additional load on instructors, helpers and participants.
People were often not familiar with non-verbal reactions, which were used to indicate progress with exercises and
quickly poll the audience. Frequent updates to video conferencing tools introduced further inconsistencies between
different versions owned by participants. Poor Internet connections resulted in many participants not sharing their
videos, which, coupled with the lack of non-verbal feedback, made it harder to know if people were following.

There is a number of video conferencing tools in use (e.g. Blackboard Collaborate, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, etc.),
each with its own intricacies; the choice is often mandated by the institution hosting the workshop. The use of
chat is crucial to keep everyone engaged and for answering questions in the background by helpers, and often
superseded the use of shared notes documents (as this was one extra window to manage in often limited screen estate).
The use of integrated chats was preferred to standalone chat tools such as Slack, and was perceived as less
distracting and easier to catch up with.

### New inclusivity and accessibility concerns

We faced some new inclusivity and accessibility concerns as we aimed to be inclusive of learners from different
time zones and with varying levels of technical equipment for video calls and quality of Internet connection.
In many countries, learners were reliant on access to computer labs at their institutions, which was restricted
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many did not have access to personal laptops or PCs.
Online workshops were great for some people, but also highly exclusive and inaccessible for others with 
technical or hearing issues, caring or home-schooling duties.

### Video conferencing takes toll

[Video conferencing fatigue](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Zoom-fatigue-virtual-meeting-fatigue#:~:text=Zoom%20fatigue%2C%20also%20known%20as,series%20of%20virtual%20video%20meetings.&text=The%20concept%20of%20Zoom%20fatigue,remotely%20during%20the%20global%20pandemic.) refers to
the feeling of mental and physical exhaustion we often experience after attending a series of virtual meetings, 
due (but not limited) to increased eye strain, increased cognitive load and mental processing to read non-verbal cues, 
and reduced mobility [[ref](https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/)].
Half-day workshop formats (instead of the usual intensive two full-day workshops) are less tiring for 
both audience and instructors, allowing learners time to reflect on what was covered on the day and 
everyone to still carry out some of their (work or personal) daily tasks. Agendas for online 
workshops (and events in general) must have sufficient breaks (e.g. after 45 - 60 minutes of teaching) 
for them to be effective and less tiring for those who are attending.

### Key message

I quite like this quote from: https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/12/Carpentries-Online-Workshops/ and wonder if we could 
incorporate it somehow:
`“Our community is very patient, resilient and very resourceful.”`
